    <p>
      More specifically, we may need to process your data or

        <b>Third-Party Advertisers.</b> We may use third-party
        advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites or Apps. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites that are contained in web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

           such as your geographic area or demographic information.

    <h3 id="sec6">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>


    <p>
      <i>
        <b>In Short:</b> If you choose to register or log in to our websites using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
      </i>
    </p>


    <p>
      Our Sites or Apps offer you the ability to register and login
       using your third party social media account details (like your
       Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
       receive certain profile information about you from your social media
       provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending
       on the social media provider concerned, but will often include
       your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well
       as other information you choose to make public.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes
      that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise
      made clear to you on the Sites or Apps. Please note that we do not
      control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
      information by your third party social media provider. We recommend
      that you review their privacy policy to understand how they collect,
      use and share your personal information, and how you can set your
      privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

      <i>
        <b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.

    </p>

    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
      necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless
      a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
      accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy
      will require us keeping your personal information for longer
      than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
      we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this
      is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
      in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
      and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>



    <h3 id="sec8">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

    <p>
      <i>
        <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.

    </p>

    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
      security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
      information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot
      guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do
      our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
      information to and from our Sites or Apps is at your own risk. You should
      only access the services within a secure environment.
    </p>

      18 years of age. By using the Sites or Apps, you represent that
      you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of
      such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the
      Sites or Apps. If we learn that personal information from users
      less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate
      the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such
      data from our records. If you become aware of any data we have
      collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:seanverhaagen@gmail.com">seanverhaagen@gmail.com</a>.

      </a>
    </p>

    <b>Account Information</b>

    <p>
      If you would at any time like to review or change the

    <h3 id="sec11">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
      include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal
      your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
      monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
      implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently
      respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
      communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
      tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
      you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
